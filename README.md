# spring-thymeleaf-poc

Minimal PoC for Server-rendered frontend using Thymeleaf and itÂ´s Spring integration. 

A content object made of two `String` `key` and `value` is sent to the backend using a html form and *validated* there. The `(key, value)`  are written to stdin.

This PoC showcases:
* Exception handling
* Html Form with backend validation
* click button to download sample json
* Use of Resource Bundles
* How to place and reference css
* How to include a favicon to avoid the annoying 404 on the web dev tools.
